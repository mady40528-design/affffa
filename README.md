# 🖥️ MIPS Processor Implementations (Verilog HDL)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains multiple implementations of the **MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages)** architecture using **Verilog HDL**.  
The project is designed for **educational and academic purposes**, helping students understand CPU architecture and datapath/control design.

It includes **Single-Cycle**, **Multi-Cycle**, and **5-Stage Pipelined** MIPS processors.

## 🧠 Implemented Architectures

### 🔹 Single-Cycle Processor
- Each instruction completes in **one clock cycle**
- Simple and clear datapath
- Ideal for learning CPU fundamentals
- Best for understanding datapath and control logic

📁 Folder: `Single-Cycle/`

---

### 🔹 Multi-Cycle Processor
- Instructions are executed over **multiple clock cycles**
- Reuses hardware components across cycles
- More efficient than single-cycle in terms of clock period
- Demonstrates FSM-based control design

📁 Folder: `Multi-Cycle/`

---

### 🔹 Pipelined Processor
- Classic **5-stage MIPS pipeline**:
  - Instruction Fetch (IF)
  - Instruction Decode (ID)
  - Execute (EX)
  - Memory Access (MEM)
  - Write Back (WB)
- Includes:
  - Forwarding unit
  - Hazard detection
  - Stall insertion
- Higher instruction throughput compared to single-cycle

📁 Folder: `Pipeline/`

---

## 🧩 Supported Instruction Types
- **R-Type Instructions**
- **I-Type Instructions**
- **J-Type Instructions**

(Details for each instruction set can be found inside the README of each folder.)
